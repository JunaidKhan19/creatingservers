this is a server based on express.js 
express allows us to create server and provides us many functionalities like request, response and next.
next helps us to use middlewares such that if a request-response is resolved what to do next.
in express .use method is written to use pre defined middlewares but also we can use custom made middlewares.
everything remains the same as in the http server just the way of writing routes is changed as we use .get, .use, etc., methods provided by express.js.
