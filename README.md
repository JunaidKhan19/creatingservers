# 🧠 Server Learning Repository

This repository is dedicated to learning and experimenting with **server creation techniques** using various tools and technologies.  
It includes multiple small projects demonstrating different approaches to backend development — from basic HTTP servers to REST APIs and authentication systems.

Some projects from this repo may also be **hosted live separately** for demonstration purposes.  

> 📘 Each project has its own `README.md` file with details about its setup, features, and usage.

## 🚀 Objectives

- Understand how backend servers work  
- Learn different ways to handle requests and responses  
- Practice routing, middleware, and modular server design  
- Experiment with authentication, databases, and deployment

## 🧩 Topics Covered

| Category | Topics |
|:----------|:--------|
| **Server Basics** | Node.js HTTP server, Express.js setup, routes, and middleware |
| **APIs** | REST API creation, CRUD operations |
| **Authentication** | JWT, sessions, and cookies |
| **Database Integration** | MongoDB (Mongoose), JSON-based storage |
| **Deployment** | Hosting APIs on Render, Vercel, or other platforms |

---


Each folder represents a **standalone learning project** with its own dependencies, explanation, and features.

## 🧪 Example Projects

| Project | Description |
|:---------|:-------------|
| **Basic HTTP Server** | A simple Node.js server handling GET and POST requests |
| **Express CRUD API** | REST API for managing data with CRUD routes |
| **JWT Authentication App** | Implements user authentication using JWT tokens |
| **MongoDB Integration Demo** | Demonstrates connection between Express and MongoDB |

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

Here’s what I’ve learned and practiced while working on each project in this repository:

| Project | Key Learning Outcomes |
|:----------|:----------------------|
| **Basic HTTP Server** | Learned how to handle raw HTTP requests and responses using Node’s built-in `http` module. Practiced parsing query parameters and managing routes manually. |
| **Express Server Setup** | Understood how Express simplifies server creation with routing, middleware, and request handling. |
| **CRUD REST API** | Learned how to design RESTful routes, manage resources, and perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations efficiently. Gained hands-on experience with JSON parsing and status codes.  |
